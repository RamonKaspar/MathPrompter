# MathPrompter Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the techniques presented in the research paper "MathPrompter: Mathematical Reasoning Using Large Language Models" by Shima Imani, Liang Du, and Harsh Shrivastava from Microsoft Research. The implementation aims to replicate the improved performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in arithmetic reasoning tasks using the MathPrompter technique.

### Installation

Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamonKaspar/MathPrompter.git
cd MathPrompter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To use the MathPrompter, run the main script or import functions directly into your Python projects:

```bash
python main.py
```

Detailed documentation on function usage and parameters can be found in the docstrings within the code.
